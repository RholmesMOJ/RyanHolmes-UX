            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <summary><p>As a UX designer, I’ve always been passionate about maintaining a healthy design system. A design system is the backbone of consistency, but what happens when the guidance in the system starts to feel incomplete or ambiguous? While working at the Ministry of Justice this was one of the department's problems.</p>

            <p>While I was working with designers within my prototype guidance sessions I became quickly aware of the problems facing my colleagues. I also had moments when I couldn’t find clear guidance. </p>


            <h2>Actions</h2>

            <p>I firstly reached out to the lead designer in charge of running the MOJ design system. I needed to understand whether or not they were planning to update guidance materials in their latest round of updates. However, it was not on their roadmap due to focusing on building up other areas such as components etc.</p>

            <p>I then began working with a content designer from the design system team to figure out how to present and update the material. While there were solid base principles, outside of components, patterns and pages it didn’t give the necessary details for other design challenges. </p>

            <p>I then shared some of my findings from the community around where people were struggling with guidance as well as other problems. I additionally began to compare our design system with other departments to see what they were doing. I noticed that our support for prototyping could definitely be improved.</p>

            <p>I realised that the design system lacked in the area of informing designers of different prototyping methods and their benefits. I began to collate the pros and cons of every fidelity level of prototyping available at the MOJ. This then formed the basis of the new page of guidance. The page was most recently updated with the content and was received positively within the community. </p>

            <p>Next I realised that our structure for presenting this information should and could be improved as it was currently restrictive. This new iteration giving us a new sitemap will free up the ability to present the content needed. It also has given myself a bit more direction in thinking of additional materials related to the prototyping not currently available. This will be running locally, github desktop stuff, hosting on cloud platform and more tutorial based guidance.</p>

            <p>By continuing to identify gaps, and working closely with other designers and content designers, I am helping to create better guidance. This has allowed the MOJ to start to elevate the quality and usability of its design system.<p>
