            <h1 class="project-title">MOJ - DESIGN COMMUNITY - PROTOTYPE KIT TRAINING</h1>
            <h2>The project</h2>
            <summary><p>After noticing there was a need for leadership on the prototype kit training within the design community, I knew I wanted to share the skills I had learned with others. When kicking this off the first thing I did was to do some research with the community. I really wanted to understand firstly whether or not there was an appetite for this, how people wanted the lessons to be structured, what things people wanted to learn etc. </p></summary>

            <h2>State of play</h2>

            <summary><p>When I first began my career I attended a GDS prototype kit training course while I was working for the Department for International Trade. I found this course invaluable, and knew that it would also be helpful to others who were also new to HTML/CSS. I then contacted the prototype kit team on xgov slack channel and set up a meeting. Due to covid-19, GDS were not able to run in-house training, plus the designer who ran the training had left. During my time with GDS it also became obvious that there was no plan to replace the colleague, or kick start the course off again.</p></summary>

            <h2>My approach</h2>
            <p>I started out by creating a slack channel where I would be able to interact with the community and have a specific place for asking them prototype kit training questions. This helped massively for helping to keep discussions visible and  not getting lost in the noise of member heavy slack spaces. It also helped in spreading the word to other communities such as the research and content design who also had members keen in learning more about the kit. 

            Now I knew that there was an interest in having kit tutorials. I then began putting together a research plan - this took shape in a google form. This was shared within the design community through various slack channels and design meet ups.</p>

            <p>I wanted to gauge the level of understanding of the community and also find out the best way for the tutorials to take place.  The results were  encouraging and showed there was a real variation in knowledge with some people proficient and others were fresh to it. It was however really refreshing to see the interest was not just from interaction designers -  but also from Delivery Managers, Project Managers and User researchers.</p>

            <p>I analysed the findings from the form - there were some clear patterns and takeaways, which helped shape the tutorials. </p>

            <p>Firstly, I noticed that the post covid-19 mostly remote working structure meant in-house training would not work. The community overwhelmingly voted for the sessions to be online, group and remote. </p>

              <figure class="compare">
               <img src="images/prototype-2.png" class="example" alt="">
              <figcaption>Another question we asked</figcaption>
            </figure>

           <p> Due to the nature of the people interested in the kit it became obvious that there was a real mix in knowledge. There were people who were approaching this for the first time (20% of people who took the form were interested in the next thing they learned how to set the kit up) and then there were others who were proficient in the kit and wanted to take their skill to the next level (20% people who wanted to know how to conditionally pass data between pages). </p>

            <p>I then used this information to create a rough guide, one which would show how I wanted to approach making people ready for the tutorial and then what would be covered in each session. 
            </p>

            <p> At this point I realised that I myself was still on a journey on learning a lot about the kit.  For this to be successful and to operate smoothly it became clear I needed help and I was fortunate enough that Dan Guy offered time to help out and host the tutorials. </p>

            </figure>

            <p>Once Dan joined, we then began to really look at the tutorials and the materials needed. We decided to do a mini service where the participants would spin up a mini prototype based around someone changing their name. This project would then allow us to also organically move through from simpler interactions, through to the more complex ones with a level of consistency. </p>

            <p>In total there were five tutorials that we ran; Set up, Basic flow, Passing data, Branching and using Github. These tutorials now live within our shared drive community, youtube and also they are pinned into the prototype kit training slack channel where all members of the MOJ are able to interact with them. </p>

              <figcaption>More findings from our survey</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Though feedback from the community was positive, it became clear a number of factors came into play and the momentum fizzled away. However, it became apparent to myself that some people were still finding the tutorials who did not attend or had started the department after and were interacting with them post recording. I then had the idea to record shorter and more precise videos. This was in response to conversations I had where I was told that while having session tutorials was great, sometimes having to scroll through a video or play at a higher speed to find the correct part could be time consuming. </p>

            <p>These recordings are now being worked on along with accompanying content, which will now be stored in a playbook. This is the work I am currently doing alongside another designer Rich, which will allow the prototype kit training to keep evolving and to deliver value within the community.  </p>
