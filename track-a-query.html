            <h1 class="project-title"> Track a Query - Central Digital - Ministry of Justice </h1>


           <p> While working in Central Digital in the Staff Tools and Services team working on a service for the Branston Registry team called Track a Query . The service's main purpose was to handle different types of requests from prisoners such as Offender Subject Access Requests, Non Offender Subject Access requests, Freedom of Information requests and others.  </p>

           <p> The existing system for taking these requests was an outdated legacy system, which was not accessible and also had large parts being completed on spreadsheets. This resulted in staff making many errors, GDPR failures and complicated cases were hard to follow.</p>

             <p>Unfortunately, because of covid restrictions the office was running at a reduced capacity. In August 2021 there were over 7000 overdue SARs. This meant that huge fines were being levied by the Information Commissioner's Office to the department.  </p>

             <p> After research sessions with stakeholders I was able to attain some priorities for early design iterations. It was obvious that logging the request types first would be the most appropriate, focusing mainly on the Subject Access Request type. </p>

             <p>In the meetings with stakeholders it was crucial to know how the requests would come in and then their life cycle once created. From these sessions I was able to further understand the priorities. This helped with forming the basis of initial designs. </p>

             <p>I moved through fidelity starting with paper before moving to Figma and code using the Gov prototype kit. I used these designs to facilitate three amigos sessions with developers to establish if patterns were technically feasible. </p>

             <p>While the development began on the first set of requests, I began working on delivering the three different complaint types. These were for those normal complaints, those from the Information Commission Office and the Litigation complaint type. These were at the time mainly compiled on spreadsheets, which was a GDPR breach and a nightmare to manage. </p>

             <p>Based on testing feedback, I created a service which allowed users to correctly move the requests through the various stages of the complaints, attaching any documents, linking old cases and allowing notes to be added.  </p>

             <p>This resulted in a service where all of the information regarding these cases was easy to find as well as being all in the same place. This made a huge difference for users preparing for court as it meant time was not spent gathering all of this information from various share folders and for work to be done on other more important areas such as managing covid backlogs. </p>

             <p>After launch, I was able to set up systems for ongoing user feedback. I was able to track key metrics like completion rates, time it took to complete a specific case stage, and common errors. Additionally I was able to focus on the areas where users struggled with the new system. This led me to help in developing user guides and as well as conducting demos of the new service. </p>

             <p>The new complaints logging system reduced time spent managing complaints. This was extremely helpful when it came to preparing for court cases. This resulted in alleviating stress on the department as failure to comply would result in huge fines.   </p>

             <p> By delivering small and working in an agile method we were able to incrementally improve the service. This did not overwhelm staff with having to learn a large number of new processes. 
             </p>

             <p> Staff began to use the new complaints system and were able to better prepare for the Litigation court meetings. They were able to clear a lot of the backlog and begin to take new request types. This allowed the team to avoid fines from the ICO. 
             </p>
